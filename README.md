This Minecraft Spigot plugin turns the Big Dripleaves in your world into launchpads! Highly configurable, great for parkour and minigames, or just making lush caves more exciting.  

When a player waits on a drip leaf, instead of giving up and sadly dropping the player to the ground, the leaf will fight back by sending the player flying!

## Options
The config has many options making this plugin extremely customizable, the default config and all options are [available here](https://github.com/coolbot100s/Bouncy-Leaves/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml).  

### Some particularly notable features are:  
- Changing how far the drip leaf has to tilt before launching the player.  
- Vertical and Horizontal force applied to the player when launched, these can be a range that is randomly selected from allowing for unpredictable variation!  
- Whether or not a player can be affected by more than one leaf at once.  
- Whether the player can sneak in order to avoid being launched.  
- Whether players should take fall damage after being launched.

There is also a single **permission** `bouncyLeaves.canBounce`, enabled by default that determines if a player can be launched by drip leaves or not.  
Adding and revoking this permission allows admins to use this feature in certain areas, or at certain times such as minigame and parkour zones without affecting survival gameplay.
